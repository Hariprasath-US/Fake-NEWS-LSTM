# Fake News Detection with LSTM

Deep learning project for fake news detection using LSTM neural networks in Keras/TensorFlow.

## 📰 Dataset
- News articles labeled as fake or real (e.g., Kaggle Fake News Dataset).

## ⚙️ Features
- Data cleaning & tokenization
- Word embedding (Tokenizer + Embedding layer)
- LSTM model architecture
- Accuracy and loss visualization

## 🛠 Installation
```bash
pip install pandas numpy keras tensorflow nltk matplotlib
```

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
jupyter notebook FakeNews_LSTM.ipynb
```

## 📈 Results
LSTM achieved good accuracy on validation set; includes training history plots.
